The staff was friendly and attentive. The elevators are tiny (about -' by -'). The food in the restaurant was delicious but priced a little on the high side. Of course this is Washington DC. There is no pool and little for children to do. My room on the fifth floor had two comfortable beds and plenty of space for one person. The TV is a little small by todays standards with a limited number of channels. There was a small bit of mold in the bathtub area that could have been removed with a little bleach. It appeared the carpets were not vacummed every day. I reported a light bulb was burned out. It was never replaced. Ice machines are on the odd numbered floors, but the one on my floor did not work. I encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and I mentioned the ice machine to them. Severel hours later a maid appeared at my door with ice and two mints. I'm not sure how they knew what room I was in. That was a little unnerving! I would stay here again for business, but would not come here on vacation.

The bathroom amenities were also minimal. We did not have a fridge or a microwave and had to again rent a fridge from the staff (to keep baby things).\n",

We all loved the hotel, great experience. Ask for a room on the North tower, facing north west for the best views. We had a high floor, with a stunning view of the needle, the city, and even the cruise ships! We ordered room service for dinner so we could enjoy the perfect views. Room service dinners were delicious, too! You are in a perfect spot to walk everywhere, so enjoy the city. Almost forgot- Heavenly beds were heavenly, too!

We had planned this weekend getaway back in February, so we were all looking forward to it. There was - of us so we rented - ajoining rooms at the rate of $----night-room. We stayed - nights so with taxes and parking charges we spent in total over $----. All of us expected a certain level of service since we were staying at the Ritz, however this hotel certainly didn't meet what we would consider Ritz standards.\n",
       "The rooms were fine. They were clean with well appointed bathrooms, but nothing to get excited about. The service however was awful. The first night we were there, I made -- calls to the bell man, before someone in hotel communications picked up the phone. Then on Saturday night before we left for dinner at -:--, we requested to have extra hotels delivered to our room and our trash removed. When we returned at --:--, neither request was fullfilled. I made another call to housekeeping and then finally things were taken care of. In my opinion, for the rates we were paying, we should have had nightly turn down service.\n",
       "I did speak with a manager when we checked out and he said he would make it worth our while to return, however all we received was a letter of apology.\n",
       "Needless to say, we have no plans to return to this hotel. My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Boston in February of ---- and had a wonderful stay. The service there was impeccable as is service at all the Four Seaons that I have stayed at. If you are willing to pay Ritz Carlton prices, then I would recommend staying at the Four Seasons instead!</td><td>Edge                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td><td>Tablet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td><td>not happy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr>\n",

One was very nice and clearly had been updated more recently than the other. The other was clean and the bed was comfy but it needed some updating (carpet was old and wrinkled for example). Great location for visiting Inner Harbor, getting to Fells Point, Orioles games etc. SuperShuttle from BWI worked great both ways. TV remotes in both rooms were terrible but we didn't watch much TV so not a big deal. Wireless was sketchy on --th and --th floors but again, didn't need it much - we were on vacation so it didn't really matter. Breakfast was good each morning. Would stay again if in town.

The staff was friendly and attentive. The elevators are tiny (about -' by -'). The food in the restaurant was delicious but priced a little on the high side. Of course this is Washington DC. There is no pool and little for children to do. My room on the fifth floor had two comfortable beds and plenty of space for one person. The TV is a little small by todays standards with a limited number of channels. There was a small bit of mold in the bathtub area that could have been removed with a little bleach. It appeared the carpets were not vacummed every day. I reported a light bulb was burned out. It was never replaced. Ice machines are on the odd numbered floors, but the one on my floor did not work. I encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and I mentioned the ice machine to them. Severel hours later a maid appeared at my door with ice and two mints. I'm not sure how they knew what room I was in. That was a little unnerving! I would stay here again for business, but would not come here on vacation.

We all loved the hotel, great experience. Ask for a room on the North tower, facing north west for the best views. We had a high floor, with a stunning view of the needle, the city, and even the cruise ships! We ordered room service for dinner so we could enjoy the perfect views. Room service dinners were delicious, too! You are in a perfect spot to walk everywhere, so enjoy the city. Almost forgot- Heavenly beds were heavenly, too!

We had planned this weekend getaway back in February, so we were all looking forward to it. There was - of us so we rented - ajoining rooms at the rate of \\$----night-room. We stayed - nights so with taxes and parking charges we spent in total over \\$----. All of us expected a certain level of service since we were staying at the Ritz, however this hotel certainly didn't meet what we would consider Ritz standards.\n",
       "The rooms were fine. They were clean with well appointed bathrooms, but nothing to get excited about. The service however was awful. The first night we were there, I made -- calls to the bell man, before someone in hotel communications picked up the phone. Then on Saturday night before we left for dinner at -:--, we requested to have extra hotels delivered to our room and our trash removed. When we returned at --:--, neither request was fullfilled. I made another call to housekeeping and then finally things were taken care of. In my opinion, for the rates we were paying, we should have had nightly turn down service.\n",
       "I did speak with a manager when we checked out and he said he would make it worth our while to return, however all we received was a letter of apology.\n",
       "Needless to say, we have no plans to return to this hotel. My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Boston in February of ---- and had a wonderful stay. The service there was impeccable as is service at all the Four Seaons that I have stayed at.

One was very nice and clearly had been updated more recently than the other. The other was clean and the bed was comfy but it needed some updating (carpet was old and wrinkled for example). Great location for visiting Inner Harbor, getting to Fells Point, Orioles games etc. SuperShuttle from BWI worked great both ways. TV remotes in both rooms were terrible but we didn't watch much TV so not a big deal. Wireless was sketchy on --th and --th floors but again, didn't need it much - we were on vacation so it didn't really matter. Breakfast was good each morning.

The staff was friendly and attentive. The elevators are tiny (about -' by -'). The food in the restaurant was delicious but priced a little on the high side. Of course this is Washington DC. There is no pool and little for children to do. My room on the fifth floor had two comfortable beds and plenty of space for one person. The TV is a little small by todays standards with a limited number of channels. There was a small bit of mold in the bathtub area that could have been removed with a little bleach. It appeared the carpets were not vacummed every day. I reported a light bulb was burned out. It was never replaced. Ice machines are on the odd numbered floors, but the one on my floor did not work. I encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and I mentioned the ice machine to them. Severel hours later a maid appeared at my door with ice and two mints. I'm not sure how they knew what room I was in. That was a little unnerving! I would stay here again for business, but would not come here on vacation.

We all loved the hotel, great experience. Ask for a room on the North tower, facing north west for the best views. We had a high floor, with a stunning view of the needle, the city, and even the cruise ships! We ordered room service for dinner so we could enjoy the perfect views. Room service dinners were delicious, too! You are in a perfect spot to walk everywhere, so enjoy the city. Almost forgot- Heavenly beds were heavenly, too!

We had planned this weekend getaway back in February, so we were all looking forward to it. There was - of us so we rented - ajoining rooms at the rate of $----night-room. We stayed - nights so with taxes and parking charges we spent in total over $----. All of us expected a certain level of service since we were staying at the Ritz, however this hotel certainly didn't meet what we would consider Ritz standards.\n",
       "The rooms were fine. They were clean with well appointed bathrooms, but nothing to get excited about. The service however was awful. The first night we were there, I made -- calls to the bell man, before someone in hotel communications picked up the phone. Then on Saturday night before we left for dinner at -:--, we requested to have extra hotels delivered to our room and our trash removed. When we returned at --:--, neither request was fullfilled. I made another call to housekeeping and then finally things were taken care of. In my opinion, for the rates we were paying, we should have had nightly turn down service.\n",
       "I did speak with a manager when we checked out and he said he would make it worth our while to return, however all we received was a letter of apology.\n",
       "Needless to say, we have no plans to return to this hotel. My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Boston in February of ---- and had a wonderful stay. The service there was impeccable as is service at all the Four Seaons that I have stayed at. If you are willing to pay Ritz Carlton prices, then I would recommend staying at the Four Seasons instead! | Edge                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Tablet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | not happy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | \n",

One was very nice and clearly had been updated more recently than the other. The other was clean and the bed was comfy but it needed some updating (carpet was old and wrinkled for example). Great location for visiting Inner Harbor, getting to Fells Point, Orioles games etc. SuperShuttle from BWI worked great both ways. TV remotes in both rooms were terrible but we didn't watch much TV so not a big deal. Wireless was sketchy on --th and --th floors but again, didn't need it much - we were on vacation so it didn't really matter. Breakfast was good each morning.

       "1 The room was kind of clean but had a VERY strong smell of dogs. Generally below average but ok for a overnight stay if you're not too fussy. Would consider staying again if the price was right.

       "2 I stayed at the Crown Plaza April -- - April --, ----. The staff was friendly and attentive. The elevators are tiny (about -' by -'). The food in the restaurant was delicious but priced a little on the high side. Of course this is Washington DC. There is no pool and little for children to do. My room on the fifth floor had two comfortable beds and plenty of space for one person. The TV is a little small by todays standards with a limited number of channels. There was a small bit of mold in the bathtub area that could have been removed with a little bleach. It appeared the carpets were not vacummed every day. I reported a light bulb was burned out. It was never replaced. Ice machines are on the odd numbered floors, but the one on my floor did not work. I encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and I mentioned the ice machine to them. Severel hours later a maid appeared at my door with ice and two mints. I'm not sure how they knew what room I was in. That was a little unnerving! I would stay here again for business, but would not come here on vacation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "3 I booked this hotel through Hotwire at the lowest price I could find. When we got there the front desk manager gave us a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"smoking\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" room. I argued that I have a little baby and I would not have booked the room had I known it was smoking. The manager would not hear anything further and told me that Hotwire books the cheapest rooms that are available. So, from the get go I was very unhappy.\\nAfter a great deal of persuasion and discussion, I got a nonsmoking room. Thereafter the room had the most minimal amenities. Besides the great location (near Dupont Circle), there was not much to say about this overpriced hotel. The room was small and in OK condition. The bathroom was small with a tub. The bathroom amenities were also minimal. We did not have a fridge or a microwave and had to again rent a fridge from the staff (to keep baby things).\\nThe parking costs $-- per day so it is best not to drive here. Also the breakfast is not included. The lobby is very small and feels old. The only thing available is coffee in the lobby which is decent.\\nAll in all, poor service, minimal amenities, small rooms, small bathrooms, no view, but great location. Some distance from the metro (either McPherson station or Dupont station). Try to look for better if available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "4 Stayed here with husband and sons on the way to an Alaska Cruise. We all loved the hotel, great experience. Ask for a room on the North tower, facing north west for the best views. We had a high floor, with a stunning view of the needle, the city, and even the cruise ships! We ordered room service for dinner so we could enjoy the perfect views. Room service dinners were delicious, too! You are in a perfect spot to walk everywhere, so enjoy the city. Almost forgot- Heavenly beds were heavenly, too!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "5 My girlfriends and I stayed here to celebrate our --th birthdays. We had planned this weekend getaway back in February, so we were all looking forward to it. There was - of us so we rented - ajoining rooms at the rate of $----night-room. We stayed - nights so with taxes and parking charges we spent in total over $----. All of us expected a certain level of service since we were staying at the Ritz, however this hotel certainly didn't meet what we would consider Ritz standards.\\nThe rooms were fine. They were clean with well appointed bathrooms, but nothing to get excited about. The service however was awful. The first night we were there, I made -- calls to the bell man, before someone in hotel communications picked up the phone. Then on Saturday night before we left for dinner at -:--, we requested to have extra hotels delivered to our room and our trash removed. When we returned at --:--, neither request was fullfilled. I made another call to housekeeping and then finally things were taken care of. In my opinion, for the rates we were paying, we should have had nightly turn down service.\\nI did speak with a manager when we checked out and he said he would make it worth our while to return, however all we received was a letter of apology.\\nNeedless to say, we have no plans to return to this hotel. My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Boston in February of ---- and had a wonderful stay. The service there was impeccable as is service at all the Four Seaons that I have stayed at. If you are willing to pay Ritz Carlton prices, then I would recommend staying at the Four Seasons instead!\n",
       "6 We had - rooms. One was very nice and clearly had been updated more recently than the other. The other was clean and the bed was comfy but it needed some updating (carpet was old and wrinkled for example). Great location for visiting Inner Harbor, getting to Fells Point, Orioles games etc. SuperShuttle from BWI worked great both ways. TV remotes in both rooms were terrible but we didn't watch much TV so not a big deal. Wireless was sketchy on --th and --th floors but again, didn't need it much - we were on vacation so it didn't really matter. Breakfast was good each morning. Would stay again if in town.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
